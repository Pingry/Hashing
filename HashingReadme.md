#Hashing 

For this project, you need to create a hash function for an Object. Your class, called <YourName>Hasher.java, will extend Hasher.java, provided in the Hashing repository. You will create a hash method that takes in an Object and hashes it based on an algorithm of your design. 

* You may not call Object's hashcode function.
* You must extend Hasher.java
* You do have access to the object's toString method
* You may create additional private helper methods
* You may not take hash function examples from the Internet 
* You may use other classes/methods in the Java API, but not if they are specifically related to hashing.
